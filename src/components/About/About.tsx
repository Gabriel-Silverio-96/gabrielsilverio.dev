		<p>Hi, Gabriel here</p>
		<p>I'm frontend developer and I love to build anything with codes.</p>

		<p>
			I like to read a good fiction or drama book and once in a while play
			a retro game which are my favorites and I like cooking.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm working in software development since 2016, and I've already
			collaborated on software from various fields such as marketing,
			judicial, animal protection, construction, e-commerce and education. I always
			love a new adventure and learn something new.
		</p>

		<p>Teamwork is the key to success =)</p>
